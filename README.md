# Need: Image Search

The problem is that a user needs to search for a specific image in box full of thousands of pictures.  

To identify the specific image, the program will tell what the loaded image is.

To do this, I used python, installed the pillow library, torchvision library, and used a pretrained machine learning model.

First, I used python in anaconda, and then I installed the packages, pillow and torchvision. I stored some images in my hard disk where the program could read them and tell me exactly what was in the picture.
